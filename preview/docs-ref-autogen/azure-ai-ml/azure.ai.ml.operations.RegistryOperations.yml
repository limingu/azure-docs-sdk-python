    Create a new Azure Machine Learning Registry, or try to update if it already exists.


    Note: Due to service limitations we have to sleep for

    an additional 30~45 seconds AFTER the LRO Poller concludes

    before the registry will be consistently deleted from the

    perspective of subsequent operations.

    If a deletion is required for subsequent operations to

    work properly, callers should implement that logic until the

    service has been fixed to return a reliable LRO.'
