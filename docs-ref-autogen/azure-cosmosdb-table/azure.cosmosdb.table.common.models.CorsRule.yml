summary: 'CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one
  domain

  to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security

  restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from calling

  APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to allow one domain

  (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain.
